/**
 * This class helps separate and program the game according to 4 game phases. MÃ¤xchen itself has a minimum of 3 stages. (Tic-Tac-Toe e.g is just a 1-phase game)
 * The 4th phase that was implemented here is used to separate the rounds (Player 1 vs Player 2) from each other. The current Player has to press an "End Turn" Button and pass on the computer to the other player before the game can continue.
