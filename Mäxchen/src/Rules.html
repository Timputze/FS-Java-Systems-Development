<h3> DrunkMäxchen Rules</h3>
<p> You might ask yourself the following: How does a game of drunkMäxchen work? Here are the Game Rules that define Team2´s version. </p>
<p> The Rules to this game are not very different from the normal version. Differences are: </p>
<li>1. Players cannot lie a value that would be less than the previous player´s told dice value. It is only possible to lie the same value or a greater one.</li>
<li>2. During the game, it is not possible to just take the cup, shake, and pass it on without looking at the shake result (taking a "Risk").</li>
<li>3. The doubter in a game always starts a new round, no matter which player actually lost and got the penalty shot.</li>
<li>4. Penalty shots are always given out in the same amount = 1. There are no cases where multiple shots are given out in one round. </li>
<li>5. When a player rolls a Mäxchen they do not automatically win. They are still able to lie (as long as the lie value lies below the told value) or can choose to tell the truth. </li>
<li>6. If the current player receives a Mäxchen by the previous player, the current player can either doubt or believe them. If the current player believes them, they get a penalty shot because Mäxchen is the highest value. The current player then starts a new round and continues with a shake.</li>

<p><b>The most important thing however:</b> To encourage interaction between the players, the main communication is done in real life. In other words, the dice value that is exchanged between players
(either a lie or the truth) has to be done so <b> verbally. </b></p>

<h3> DrunkMäxchen Elements</h3>
<p> What do the invidividual elements do when I click on them? As the Player, you will mainly use the following buttons;</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Shake</b></li> This button allows you to "shake" the dice and receive a resulting dice pair during your turn.

    <li><b>Truth</b></li> When you "hand over" your turn to the next player, you can decide whether to lie or speak the truth concerning your result. Through the "Truth" button, your result is saved by the system as it is.

    <li><b>Lie</b></li> This button allows you to lie about your result. A pop up window will open and allows you to input a value.

    <li><b>Believe</b></li> When you receive your turn from the previous player, they will tell you the value that they have supposedly rolled. Through this button you can enter that you believe them.

    <li><b>Doubt</b></li> When you receive your turn from the previous player, they will tell you the value that they have supposedly rolled. Through this button you can enter that you doubt them.

    <li><b>EndTurn</b></li> This button officially ends the current´s players turn. It is expected from the current player to pass on the device to the next player and tell them their told dice value (lie or truth).

    <li><b>Drunk-O-Meter</b></li> The two player bars show how many times a player has drunk or lost. It increases by 10% per penalty shot.
</ol>

<p> The MenuBar should help you have more fun with the game, but is not necessary for the gameplay. Here are the following tabs: </p>
    <li><b>Helper</b>: This holds the Rules Window and the ShotRoller. This window you are reading from is the rules window. The Shot Roller is a shot generator that give you a shot suggestion. </li>
    <li><b>Customizer</b>: This allows the User to pick their own colour for the background of the game window. </li>
